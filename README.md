# arch-keylogger
This repository contains a keylogger program written in C meant to be integrated into a Linux environment. A keylogger is a program that records the keystrokes of users as they type. This type of program is typically used by threat actors to steal passwords, credit card payment information, and other sensitive digital data. The purpose of this project is to implement a traditional keylogger program for ethical hacking and cybersecurity education. For our implementation, we used a virtual machine with Arch Linux for our distribution and XFCE for our desktop environment.
